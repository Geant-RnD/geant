/**
 * @brief   User defined data structures for the CaloApp GeantV application to store/handle scoring data.
 * @author  M Novak, edits by R Schmitz
 * @date    July 2017
 *
 * GeantV takes multiple events(number of event-slots=number of buffered events), multiple primary partciles per event
 * and transport them on the same time by multiple working threads. It means that tracks (primary, secondary) that
 * belong to more than one events are distributed among multiple threads. GeantV associates a thread local data storage
 * (Geant::GeantTaskData) to each working threads and provides the possibility to the user(user application) to register
 * application specific thread local (data) objects in this thread local storage. When the transportation of an event,
 * that currently occupies one of the event-slots (one out of the "number of buffered events" possible places) is
 * completed (i.e. all the primary particles that belongs to the corresponding event and their secondaries are fully
 * transported) an application interface method [Digitize(Geant::GeantEvent*)] is invoked. GeantV provides the
 * possibility to merge the thread local user defined data (filled in the SteppingAction() interface method after each
 * simulation step in a thread local way) related to the finished event and distributed among multiple working threads.
 * This merge will return with a pointer to one of the user defined thread local data that contains the result of the
 * merge. At this point, the user can obtain all information that was defined and filled in the SteppingAction related
 * to the transported event and insert into a global data structure that cummulates information during the simulation.
 *
 * This file contains data structure to describe/handle data:
 * - per-primary particle: many simulated quantities will be collected and their mean values per primary particle will
 *                         be computed during the simulation
 * - per-event           : a GeantV event can contain more than one primary particles that are transported on the same
 *                         time. So the per-event data contains as many per-primary data structures as number of primary
 *                         particles per event.
 * - per-thread          : GeantV takes "number of buffered events" events and transport them on the same time. So the
 *                         per-thread data contains as many per-event data structures as number of events are taken and
 *                         transported on the same time.
 * Some of these per-thread data might need to be merged (from the threads) after an event is transported (after all
 * the primaries building up the event are transported like energy deposit per primary partcile if sima is computed).
 * These data will be described in the ThreadDataEvents object in this application and follows the structure described
 * above. Other data do not need to be merged from the threads after an event is completed but enough to be merged at
 * the very end of the simulation (like the angular distribution histogram). These data will be described by the
 * ThreadDataRun object.
 * An additional, global data structure, CaloAppData is defined in this application to accumulate data that belongs to
 * an event/primary particle and available after the event is transported and the corresponding thread local data are
 * merged. Only one object is created from this global data structure and writing into this global data structure is
 * protected (more than one threads can finish an (different)event and try to write into this global data structure).
