/**
 * @brief GeantV implementation of the Geant4 TestEm5 application.
 *
 * The application simulates passage of particles (type and energy configurable) through a simple thin target (material,
 * thickness, secondary production cuts are configurable). The main purpose of the simulation is to generate angular
 * distribution of charged particles transmitted through the target. However, several other quantities (like mean energy
 * deposit in target, energy leakage[both primary and secondary] and energy balance, mean number of charged and neutral
 * steps in the target, mean number of secondary partciles per particle type, transmitting/backscattering coefficients,
 * etc.) will also be collected and reported at the simulation.
