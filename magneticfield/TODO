1. Vc::SimdArray for CMSmagField to be able to use both doubles and floats of common length 8

2. A method to enforce that required functionalities exist in all steppers.(for design with only functions backend dependent, and not classes)
   Currently, need to check by hand or by implementing in driver


Dev Note:  30 March 2016 (Ananya, recorded by John A.)

1) Fully working - previous design with single classes for both Vector and scalar, with template on Backend 
  testVectorIntegrationDriver.cxx
  BenchmarkIntegrationDriver.cxx

  testVectorMagFieldEquation.cxx   ( tests only vector equation  GUV_VectorEquationOfMotion unused in any version )


2) The revised 'experimental' design, in which a single class is responsible for both scalar and vector stepping is contained in the classes:
  VecGUTCashKarpRKF45.h
  VecGUVField.h
  VecGUVMagneticField.h
  VecTMagFieldEquation.h
  VecTUniformMagField.h

These classes are no longer templated on 'Backend'

The test programs for this are:
  TestVecCashKarpStepper.cxx
  TestVecMagFieldEquation.cxx
