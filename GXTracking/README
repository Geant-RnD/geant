II. How to run applications of the coprocessor prototype

    see README under each driver of available coprocessors

III. Notes

- GPTracking : collection of converted codes from Geant4 that can be used
               as a standalone package or separated modules for GXTracking
               (default compilation option: CUDA_SEPARATE_COMPILATION ON )
