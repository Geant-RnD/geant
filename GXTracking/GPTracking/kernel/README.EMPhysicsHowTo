<How to run EMPhysics package>

Origianl Author : Dongwook Jang (jang.dongwook@gmail.com)

1. prepare physics tables as illustrated in test/tracking.cc

 - There are several tables in data directory, but Lambda.*.asc are used currently. Other data tables are used in AlongStepDoIt which is not implemented yet.
 - Tables are extracted from Geant4 runtime.
 - readTable() in /kernel/include/EMPhysics_kernel.h read text files in data directory and construct physics tables.

2. copy physics tables to device using cudaMemcpy()

3. construct appropriate physics object inside kernel as illustrated in kernel/src/tracking_kernel.cu
 - instantiate each physics object as a local variable per thread

4. initialize tables and some optional values

5. PostStepGPIL returns length while PostStepDoIt returns energy loss
 - PostStepDoIt from MultipleScattering returns 0 at this moment because it produces only secondaries
