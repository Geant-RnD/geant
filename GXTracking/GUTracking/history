Development history of GUTracking

Oct. 28, 2016 

1) Remove data members associated with the alias sampling method (fMinX, fMaxX,
   fNrow, fNcol, fMaxZelement) from EmModelBase. Each model should instantiate
   GUAliasSampler and responsible for setting up alias parameters if and only if
   the alias method is selected.
2) Introduce an alternative sampling method based on Geant4 composition and 
   rejection methods in which sequential operations are used for the 
   non-vectoriable part (i.e., do-while loop).

Oct. 16, 2016

1) Introduced a linear interpolation within the bin using the original p.d.f of 
   the alias table (based on the article, "Extending the alias Monte Carlo 
   sampling method to general distributions" by Arthur L. Edwards, James A.
   Rathkopf, and Robert K. Smidt, (1991).
2) Use the average value of the differential cross section for a given bin 
   when building p.d.f. 

Aug, 2016

1) Introduce Power2Divisor for an efficient bin manipulation

July, 2016

1) Introduce the static polymorphism for derived physics models from the base
   class EmModelBase.
2) Add a kernel for calculating the total cross section for each physics model.
