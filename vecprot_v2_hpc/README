Building

To build geant HPC use similar cmake options as in build_geantV.sh file.

BUILD_ZMQ=ON Is responsible for downloading, building and installing ZeroMQ and cppzmq(c++ bindings) to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

Running

Run CMSApp with options similar to those in cmsappcommand.sh
Required option: -v 1 (use v3 scheduler)
Important option: -b #n (worker asks for #n events at a time)
Number of events and event file is no longer needed as option.
Now instead it is configured by -e eventFiles.txt

Format of eventFiles.txt
FILE_NAME:EVENT_OFFSET:NUMBER_OF_EVENTS_TO_READ
(offset is number of first event to read in the file)
