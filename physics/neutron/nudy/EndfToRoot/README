Nudy simple endf data Tests (May, 2018, H.Kumawat)
===============================================================================

"EndfToRoot" is an executable which dumps endf file to root file which uses
TList to read files (MF in ENDF format) and sections (MT in ENDF format)
This test only asserts if data are read from all files and section and no error
is reported in the format.

To run this executable
./EndfToRoot filename.endf

Data file are given in $source/physics/data/neutron/nudy
executable can be written after uncommenting the install command and
can be used in the in the same data file directory or set path in environment
virable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"RootToSigma" is an executable which reads data data from root file
reconstructs the resonance data from file MF=2. Insert these data in file 
MF=3. 
Linearize all the cross-sections
Doppler broaden the cross-section
Unionization of the energy grid
Make Total cross-section
write the cross-sections in the file MF=3

Angular distributions are given in MF=4
These data are put in linear format of the probability if angle and probability
are given. In case of legendre polynomial, The data are constructed into 100 angular bins
and linearize again if required by linear intpolable criteria of tolerance 0.5% (Hard coded)

All MF=5 energy distributions are converted from formulas to linear energy and probability
distributions and written back in to the file

MF=6 data are energy-angle correlated data and these files having 1-7 LAWS.
LAW 2 is kept same and all other format data are converted into LAW=7 which
are linear probability distributions.

File MF=4 and MF=5 are written in file MF=6 format of LAW =2 and no more available
in these files. The data are written in MF=6

Photon data for MF=15 (continuous energy distributions) are also written in MF=6

To run this executable
./RootToSigma filename.root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"EndfToPointRoot" is an executable which construct point data from endf file to root file
which uses TList to read files (MF in ENDF format) and sections (MT in ENDF format)
It does a task of both "EndfToRoot" and "RootToSigma".
To run this executable
./EndfToPointRoot filename.endf
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"RootToRetrive" is to retrive these data for the simulation.
It can give Total cross-section, partial cross-sections, angle and energy of the secondary
neutron. Energy distributions are given in the LAB system.

To run this executable
./RootToRetrive filename.root.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Xsec" is to retrive these data for the simulation.
It can give Total cross-section, partial cross-sections, angle and energy of the secondary
neutron. Energy distributions are given in the LAB system and many more.

To run this executable
./Xsec filename.root

The filename.root passed to "Xsec" and "EndfToRetrive" should be processed through "EndfToPointRoot"
