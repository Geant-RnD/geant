/**
 * @brief   Singletone to hande energy ELossTable-s for all MaterialCuts. Each ELossTable will handle energy loss
 *          related tables for a set of MaterialCuts-s and in case of each MaterialCuts for all particles.
 * @class   ELossTableManager
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    august 2016
 *
 * All energy loss related tables is built in the main ELossTableManager::BuildELossTables() method, that must be called
 * at initialisation from the PhysicsListManager after all processes(with their models) are initialised properly to
 * build all energy loss related tables.
 *
 * Each different physics list has its own PhysicsParameters so energy loss related data like min, max energy of the
 * energy loss table might be different. So as many ELossTable-s will be created as many different PhysicsParameters
 * objects and each of them will handle only those MaterialCuts and kEnergyLoss physics process(es) that belongs to
 * region in which the PhysicsParameters object is active. Energy loss data like dedx, range, inverse range ... can be
 * obtained at run-time through the GetRestrictedDEDX, GetRestrictedRange, GetEnergyForRestrictedRange methods by
 * passing
 * pointers to the MaterialCuts and Particle object and specifying the kinetic energy of the particle.
 *
 * At the end of the run or in case of re-initialization one needs to call ELossTableManager::Clear() method to delete
 * all ELossTable objects and reset all container sizes! For makeing sure it happens, it is done in ELossTableManager::
 * BuildELossTables() before starting anything.
