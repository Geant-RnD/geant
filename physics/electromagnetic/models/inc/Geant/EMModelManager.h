/**
 * @brief   Class to handle EMModels that has been added to an EMPhysicsProcess.
 * @class   EMModelManager
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    august 2016
 *
 * Each EMPhysicsProcess has an EMModelManager member. EMModels can be added and accessed through this EMModelManager
 * member of the EMPhysicsProcess. The EMModelManager object owns all the models that have been added to it.
 *
 * At the initialization of the EMModelManager the EMModelManager: (1) will set for each EMModel-s that have been added
 * to the corresponding EMPhysicsProcess the list of active regions: (a) first the default active regions which are
 * determined by the active regions of the EMPhysicsProcess; (b) on the top of this, the user requested inactive regions
 * are considered in case of each individual EMModel-s; (2) the EMModelManager will prepare the list of active EMModel-s
 * per region collections. (3) After each EMModel-s active regions list is set, the EMModelManager will initilise all
 * EMModel-s: each EMModel-s will be initilized only for reagions where they are active.
