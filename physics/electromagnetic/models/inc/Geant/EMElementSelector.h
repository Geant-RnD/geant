 * @brief   Utility class for EMModel-s to provide common easy way to build at initialization and use at run-time target
 *          element selection for a given discrete interaction described by the given EMModel.
 * @class   EMElementSelector
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    august 2016
 *
 * Each physics models that derived from EMModel base class has the possibility to use this functionality. The derived
 * models needs to call explicitly the EMModel base class InitialiseElementSelectors method in their Initialize method
 * at the end after the model has already been initialised properly.
 *
 * Each EMElementSelector object will be specific for one EMModel, one Material/MaterialCuts and for a given Particle.
 * The collection of EMElementSelector-s (for a given EMModel, for a given Particle, for all MaterialCuts/Material)
 * will be created, build, stored at initialization and handled at run-time by the EMModel base class.
