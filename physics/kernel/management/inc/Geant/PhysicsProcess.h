 * Similarly to the Geant4 G4VProcess concept, this class specifies one single physics process for one particular
 * particle type. This is the base class from which all single physics processes, either in-flight and/or at-rest, must
 * derived from. As in Geant4, it has two main types of methods, "GetLength" (called here differently but with the same
 * property) and "DoIt", and (at most) three main "components": along-the-step (continuous), post-step (discrete) and
 * at-rest.

   *  Each process that has discrete part (except some special processes like multiple scattering) needs to implement
   *  this method. The macroscopic cross section for a given material, interaction is defined in terms of the
   *  corresponding elementwise atomic cross sections as their weighted sum. The weights are the number of atoms of the
   *  given element per unit volume of the material.
   *  This method is used:
   *   - either only at initialisation by the PhysicsManagerPerParticle to build both the lambda table per process and
   *     the total lambda table for the partcile. The lambda table per process is used to sample the type of discrete
   *     intercation while the total lambda table is used to sample the discrete physics step limit.
   *   - or only at run time for particles that has only one process for which the macroscopic cross section is easily
   *     computable (e.g. particles that has only decay).
   *
   *  @param[in] matcut     Material production cuts couple object in which the macroscopic cross section is requested.
   *                        Note, that the material of a MaterialCuts object can be obtained from the MaterialCuts
   *                        object.
   *  @param[in] kinenergy  Kinetic energy of the particle in internal [energy] unit.
   *  @param[in] particle   Pointer to the partcile object (NOTE:we pass this for processes that can be used for more
   * than one particle).
   *  @param[in] mass       Dynamic mass of the particle in internal [energy] units.
   *  @return               Computed macroscopic cross section in internal [1/length] unit.
