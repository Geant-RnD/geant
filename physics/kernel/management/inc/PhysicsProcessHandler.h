   *
   *  This method is the main physics initialization mathod called directly from the kernel through the interface.
   *  The kernel should pass a pinter to the geometry/materials/regions...number of working threads.
   * - base on the regions and all information stored per region (e.g. production thresholds) together with the set of
   *   materials per regions:
   *   # MategrialCuts obejcts are created and stored in the MaterialCuts table that can be accessed anywhere through
   *     the static const std::vector<MaterialCuts*>& GetTheMaterialCutsTable()
   *   # later on, the only information that we use, regarding the regions is the number of regions, that must be set in
   *     the PhysicsListManager singletone at this point by its SetNumberOfRegions(int) method.
   * NOTE: at the moment we will use our simple region class and we read and create our materials based on material
   *       names! Moreover, we can have only one region at the moment since the kernel is not able to handle regions:
   *     0 we create only 1 region and we set the production cuts.
   *     1 we loop over all TGeoMaterial and we create our own Material-s
   *     2 we add all Material objects to our only one region
   * - calls the PhysicsListManager::BuildPhysicsLists() method:
   *    # creates all particles
   *    # loops over all PhysicsList registered by the user in PhysicsListManager and calls one-by-one the
   *      Initialize() method of the registered PhysicsLists:
   *      0  each call to a PhysicsList Initialize() method will assigne processes to the temporary PhysicsProcess vector
   *         of the static particle object
   *      1  create one PhysicsManagerPerParticle object for each partcile that the current PhysicsList has added at
   *         least one PhysicsProcess
   *       2 add all processes from the current physics list to this PhysicsManagerPerParticle
   *         and push the particle to the particle list of the phsyics process that the physics process is assigned to
   *       3 also set the active region indices both in the PhysicsProcess-es(a) and in the PhysicsManagerPerParticle(b)
   *         objects
   *       4 store the created PhysicsManagerPerParticle object pointer in a table (will be used to delete and initilize
   *         only once them)
   *       5 set pointers to regional PhysicsManagerPerParticle in the static Particle definition to point to this
   *         object where the current physics list is active
   *    # each created PhysicsManagerPerParticle is initilised by calling their Initialize() method:
   *       0 each processes are initialised by calling their Initialize() method:
   *         :: it is checked in the base PhysicsProcess Initialize() method if the process is assigned only to allowed
   *            particles
   *         :: in case of EMPhysicsProcess-es (after calling the base i.e. PhysicsProcess Initialize() method)
   *            the EMModelManager member of the EMPhysicsProcess is initialized that will initialize the EMModel-s
   *            as well togeter with setting reagions where they active. The default active regions for EMModel-s are
   *            determined by the active regions of the EMPhysicsProcess(PhysicsProcess) that they belong to. On the top
   *            of this, user requested inactive regions in case of the individual EMModel-s are considered by the
   *            EMModelManager when it sets the active regions of the individual EMModel-s. At the end of initialisation
   *            of the EMModelManager member of the EMPhysicsProcess: EMModel-s per region ponters are set and the
   *            corresponding EMModel-s are initialised and each EMModel knows its list of active regions.
   *         :: if the base EMModel class InitialiseElementSelectors() method was explicitly called from the derived
   *            emmodel class Initialize() method (at the end i.e. after the model is properly initialised), then
   *            target element selector is built for the given model and tagget elemnt can be sampled at run time by the
   *            int EMModel::SampleTargetElementIndex(const MaterialCuts* matcut, double ekin, double rndm) method.
   *         :: PhysicsProcess-es set to be kEnergyLoss processes are registered in the ELossTableRegister for the given
   *            particle
   *
   *    # the ELossTableManager is initialised i.e. for all partciles that at least one PhysicsProcess::kEnergyLoss
   *      process had been registered in the ELossTableRegister: dedx, range, inverse range tables are built over an
   *      energy grid per material-cuts that belongs to region where the given process is active and run time
   *      interpolation is set up and can be used at run time to get:
   *       - restricted stopping power:
   *            double ELossTableManager::GetRestrictedDEDX(const MaterialCuts *matcut, const Particle *part,
