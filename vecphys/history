Development history of GUTracking

Jun. 20, 2016

1) add a benchmark tester for EmProcess (GPU)
2) use a common cross section data structure for EmProcess - 
   used a struct of fixed size of data members for now as the variable size
   (i.e., pointers) degrades performance on GPU significantly
3) add a skeleton for MSC

May 2, 2016

1) add EmProcess (PhotonProcess and ElectronProcess) 
2) apply clang-format
3) add a benchmark tester for EmProcess (CPU only)

Dec. 2, 2015 

1) sort input tracks by energy in ascending order
2) add hybrid Interact methods (alias + composition and rejection) for the 
   Compton (HybridCompton) and Photo-Electric model (default SauterGavrila) 

Nov. 16, 2015 

1) Add a temporary interface to the material table (MaterialHandler)
2) Add a flag to specify atomic dependency of models
3) Build a single alias table for atomic independent models
4) Build alias tables only for elements required by the material table 
   for atomic dependent models
5) Do not build alias table for benchmarking Geant4 composition and rejection 
   methods
6) Add an option for benchmarking to select one material or multiple materials

Nov. 11, 2015 

1) add an option to select a specific physics model to validate - see README file 
2) merged updates by John and Marilena:
   a) Double_t aliasInd to Index_t aliasInd 
   b) reduce MaskedAssign operations 
   c) cross section weighted bin position

Oct. 29, 2015 

1) Add an alternative sampling Kernel (SamplingMethod=kRejection) for IonisationMoller
2) Add a rudimentary shuffling Kernel (SamplingMethod=kUnpack) for ComptonKleinNishina

Oct. 28, 2015 

1) Remove data members associated with the alias sampling method (fMinX, fMaxX,
   fNrow, fNcol, fMaxZelement) from EmModelBase. Each model should instantiate
   GUAliasSampler and responsible for setting up alias parameters if and only if
   the alias method is selected.
2) Introduce an alternative sampling method based on Geant4 composition and 
   rejection methods in which sequential operations are used for the 
   non-vectoriable part (i.e., do-while loop).
3) Update benchmarking with the new sampling option

Oct. 16, 2015

1) Introduced a linear interpolation within the bin using the original p.d.f of 
   the alias table (based on the article, "Extending the alias Monte Carlo 
   sampling method to general distributions" by Arthur L. Edwards, James A.
   Rathkopf, and Robert K. Smidt, (1991).
2) Use the average value of the differential cross section for a given bin 
   when building p.d.f. 

Aug, 2015

1) Introduce Power2Divisor for an efficient bin manipulation

July, 2015

1) Introduce the static polymorphism for derived physics models from the base
   class EmModelBase.
2) Add a kernel for calculating the total cross section for each physics model.
