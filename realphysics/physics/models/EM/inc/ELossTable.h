 * ELossTableManager for each different PhysicsParameters(PhysicsList) object and the number of MaterialCuts size
 * ELossTable* vector elements of the ELossTableManager will be set to point to the one that the MaterialCuts with the
 * same index belongs to.
 * Energy loss related data for a given MaterialCuts, Particle and kinetic energy can be obtained at run-time by
 * interpolation through the GetRestrictedDEDX(), GetRestrictedRange(), GetEnergyForRestrictedRange() methods, that are
 * called by the corresponding methods of the ELossTableManager singletone.
 * Full CSDA range tables per material are also built and available at run-time if the fIsComputeCSDARange flag in the
 * PhysicsParameters object is set to true before initialization.
